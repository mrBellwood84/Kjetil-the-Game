# _Kjetil, The Game, V.1.1_

## This game is a birthday present for my dear friend Kjetil.

Play as the protagonist Kjetil as he walking down the street of Oslo while teaching bitches and asshoes a valuable lesson.

Fighting different enemies gives different kind of bonuses. They all come in handy when facing off with a boss.

This is my first game ever, and probably my last using pygame. <br>

- Version 1.0: Written as a script, quite messy
- Version 1.1: Refactored to an application structure, no new features

> written with pyhton version. 3.9.7
